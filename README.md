# etch_a_sketch

This is my Etch-a-Sketch project for the Oding Project introduction course. As I am drawing near its conclusion, I am hoping that I will learn and retain more about HTML, CSS and Javascript.
My goal is to understand better how to manipulate the DOM and gain additional knowledge of features not included in the course. We shall see how this goes.
